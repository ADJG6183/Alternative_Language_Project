 I picked Java because it's a widely-used, general-purpose programming language known for its platform independence, strong support for object-oriented programming, and extensive standard libraries. It's also popular for building robust, scalable applications.
 Java fully supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in Java, making it easy to model real-world entities and relationships. Java provides various classes and methods for file handling, including File, BufferedReader, FileReader, etc. These classes allow reading from and writing to files efficiently. In the provided code, I used BufferedReader and FileReader for reading from the CSV file.
Java supports conditional statements such as if, else if, and else for decision-making. These statements allow branching based on different conditions, enabling the execution of specific code blocks accordingly.Java supports standard assignment statements for assigning values to variables. For example, int x = 5; assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
Java supports various types of loops, including for, while, and do-while loops. These loops are used for executing a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met.
Subprograms (Methods/Functions): Java supports the creation of methods (functions) within classes. Methods encapsulate reusable code blocks and can be called from other parts of the program. In the provided code, I created methods within the Cell class for various operations. Java has robust support for unit testing through frameworks like JUnit. Unit testing is crucial for verifying the correctness of individual units of code (such as methods) in isolation. While I didn't include unit tests in the provided code, JUnit is a popular choice for writing and executing unit tests in Java. Java provides try-catch blocks for exception handling, allowing the graceful handling of runtime errors. Exceptions can be caught, logged, and appropriate actions can be taken to recover from errors. In the provided code, exception handling could be added around file I/O operations for error handling.
